My discord bot. It is currently using a flat file index.js and an attempt was made at using a mongo db to hold category entries, but for some reason my db purged its data and I realized that with no redundancy, this wouldn't be useful longterm. So I'm going to get all the functionality of indexwithmongov3 into index.js and purge mongo entries. then I'm going to use lessons learned from mongo to move to firestore/firebase with the Move to firestore v1 entry.
